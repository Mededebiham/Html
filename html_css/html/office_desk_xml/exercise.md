# Practicing XML
Think about some aspects of our universe that you want to encode, for example:
* Items on your office desk (see example `office-desk.xml`)
* Countries and cities with population
* The menu at your favorite restaurant
* Contents of your closet
* Create an XML file in a plain text editor (Notepad)

Please write your own XML file for your aspects in put it into folder 'xml'. Structure it by the XML rules. 
Also think of the self-description (doctype).
