# üë®‚Äçüíª Product landing page
If you remember the warm-up question from earlier, it is clear that in order to truly know everything about a field, one would need an extraordinary amount of time. However, that is not often what you read on the internet when it comes to certain learning products that are being sold.

"Learn Java in just 2 days and secure a job at Google with our amazing learning product."

"Become a millionaire in just one year with this eBook."

Our task is to create a landing page for a 'scammy' learning product (HTML only). As a visitor to your homepage I want to quickly get a feeling what the product is about. This should include the following elements
- A title and heading
- Add some description and what the visitor can expect
- Some price tag for the product (maybe even show an old price (tip: `<del>`)
- An image of the product / (bonus: embed a video, use Gifs)
- Style the text with html tags where appropriate (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<del>`, `mark`, `<sub>`/`<sup>` )
- Link to another page you've created (and an external page) via the link element (`<a>`)
- Also add some button spanning the page written `Buy` on it
- Create a list of contents one may expect from the product (Bonus: Next to an unordered list you may want to use an ordered list)
- For the curious
    - Explore other html tags, just to name a few: `<hr>`, ` <details>`/`<summary>`, image `<map>`, `<iframe>`, `<meter>`, `<video>`
        - Research how to create form elements and create a form to sign up for your spammy newsletter
    - Some questions to investigate
        - How to have a text like `<h1>` (as text, not evaluated as html!) in html?
        - What has accessibility to do with HTML, what are semantic tags?

**One Rule: NO CSS OR JAVASCRIPT ALLOWED!! Try to get as much as possible out of pure HTML**
